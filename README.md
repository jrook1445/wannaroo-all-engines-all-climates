# Wannaroo All Engines in All Climates

NewGRF for OpenTTD - All engines are available in all climates

1. About

All default OpenTTD engines are available in all climates. A minimal newgrf in NML so I could begin to understand vehicles. Released to the wild in case others find it interesting/useful.

2. Compatibility

Compatibility with any newgrf is not guaranteed. No warranties are expressed or implied. Not tested with OpenTTD versions < 1.9.0.

3. Features

* Enable/Disable Steam, Diesel, Electric, Monorail, Maglev, Toyland engines. Adjustable intro years for Steam, Monorail, Maglev.
* Adjustable base costs.
* Non-expiring engines: SH 8P, Dash, Floss 47, Centennial, SH 125, SH 40, AsiaStar, all monolev

4. Development

A single nml file and lang files, so nmlc alone should work. I built this newgrf on Linux Mint 19.3 using NML version 0.4.5.
